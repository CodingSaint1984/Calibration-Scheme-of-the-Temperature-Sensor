# Calibration-Scheme-of-the-Temperature-Sensor
This respository takes a certain temperature sensor as the research object, and uses statistical methods to explore the calibration scheme of the temperature sensor with nonlinear relationship between input and output. Since there are many point-selecting schemes, the time complexity of the exhaustive method is too high, so the heuristic search scheme is adopted. Genetic algorithm is a heuristic search method that imitates the natural genetic mechanism. It has high efficiency in solving such problems and can obtain an approximate solution of an optimal solution. In this paper, the genetic algorithm is used as the optimization algorithm, and the simulated annealing algorithm is used as an extension. The cubic spline interpolation method is used to find the optimal solution.
